We've all heard the phrase, ""that's what she said or she said that just to etc..."" 

It's not just Hollywood actresses but in all work environments; the two journalists are determined to make the struggle worth it and enforce the #MeToo movement 
The law rarely takes all victims stories seriously, even the newspapers bury the stories that need to be heard, there's a whole machine operating protecting abusers, for women it's a constant battle to survive no women wants their daughters to grow up in a world where being taken advantage of is okay, most just want their voice back, even actresses get blackballed and ultimately shut out of their professions because of the claims they make getting dismissed entirely, using a direct quote of the opposite sex labels you a victim, the silence is most angering given that not one person is willing to speak up 
The movie is a deep dive into investigative surgery opening up the painful truth, journalism itself is often under siege but the truth is more important 
The movie works being direct, raw, honest and doesn't pull any punches 
It stinks so many women suffer in the workplace not just the world of entertainment Takes a lot of courage to talk about the trauma that goes on behind closed curtains but even harder to actually prove it 
This film realistically gives us a sense of how an investigation is built, sources being confirmed and protected, and documents uncovered 
It's also more than just putting a predator away; it's also about other things 
It is about the rage of women compelled to be silenced for years, the empathy borne out of shared experience and existence 
This plays more like a procedural and prolly would've served better as a streaming feature like Amazon prime video or HBO Max 
And it doesn't fully make a statement on the #MeToo era 
But Mulligan and Kazan are pitch perfect as two women getting to the core of the real story and exposing all the hidden facets for real change 
The consequences someone like Harvey Weinstein faces is a pure example of when someone actually speaks up to end the vicious cycle of abuse from power hopefully for good in the upcoming days",Thread,2023-11-19T04:02:37Z,,,0,en,0.1269422438027089,0.162,0.118,0.72,0.9457,,,,

But to make a deal, with consent, and do the sexual act, even if you are cheated after that, and don't get to play the part... that's not rape! Yes! The other party should be punished, but still that's not rape! Untill you are not physically forced, or blackmaled into that situation...that's not a rape!
2. Not just man in power make these deals, there are woman in power who does the same thing! People in power make deals all around the world, and if you want to get in there films or production, and you look good, then you have a choise leave, or try to make it until you are so big, you can make the deals from the other end!
3. I'm not talking or defending that f.-er Harvey Weinstein here! I hope he rots in jail, even if one rape is truth, not to say if all of them are, I think he is lucky to be still alive!
But... for all the different deals between grown ups made, make, will make in the future...(with out the real meaning of rape) to sleep with someone for a movie part or a better future... and after that, many years later when they had the lifestyle, the money, the glamour... they decide to play the rape victim kard...Go ahead! Only one problem! Even if one of you gets to be proven wrong...(Amber Heard beating) all the real victims of rape or assault, will think twice to ever speak again!
The New York Times is no hero... they are a piece of sh_t democrat _ss lickers! But in this case... they will glorify themselves a hero!

We wish when bad things happen there are news journalists who are up in the middle of the night searching for justice... calling people and begging for the truth to come out so they can help. Crying and hoping things work out for justice sake. But reality is very different from movies. Reality is Hollywood is full of pedos and satanists who are raping little kids and sacrificing family members and murdering talent who get out of line. The truth is no one loses sleep over this. And there aren't journalists knocking on doors to bring Elites down. Reality is Harvey Weinstein pissed off the wrong people and they always had that smoking gun just in case.

Yes abusers seem to be flaunted per se, however, if there wasn't a movie and no one came forward, we wouldn't know what was really going on behind closed doors and quite honestly it could have been people we know, are close to, or even us who would be next. There are some sacrifices worth making when survivors decide to speak out. I mean even Unbelievable the docuseries and then you have documentaries on streaming apps. For example, if Osama Binladen would still be alive today and saw all of the documentaries about the attempted terrorist attacks on top of 9/11, I think quite honestly that it would be chaos because popularity is what they crave but on the other hand survivors demand that the truth be told in any of these situations, that justice be served, and that the story be made public not for the criminals fame but to protect the people and to feel that the survivors of these crimes have been heard.

Now I graduated hs in 1985 and honestly didn't think that the kind of behavior exhibeted in that movie was prevalent during my formative years or ... the 80's.

I remember watching that movie and wondering how much or what did my sisters go through.  I wondered how a man could be such a pig and then go see his mother and keep his head up.  I can say at least that my dad wasn't that kind of man.  A sister had someone touch her inappropriately and years decades later my dad talked about it.  He told me that he went tot he kids father and told him.  Either you teach him to keep his hands of girls or the next time my dad would be him ( the father ) to within an inch of his life.

I know that even today there's sexual harassment and that it is probably 100x worse than I think it is.  Sh!t there's human trafficking in women still, like it's the middle ages out there.  

I think that traffickers, pedophiles, rapists, and/or any sexual predator needs to be given the chair and not after decades of appeals.

Victor Salva has been Protected by Hollywood and his Filmmaking Career has been Controversial ever since for Good Reason. Danny Trejo was a Juvenile Delinquent before he became an Actor. He Served his Time and people have Forgiven him. But when it comes to Victor who Only did 15 Months in Jail. I'm Sorry but it's Near impossible for someone to Fully Atone for Molesting a Child. And Machete was Not a Beloved Movie Like Jeepers Creepers.

Even Nathan Lane told that bullshit, like sure YOU stood up to Harvey, you little man. Also Brad Pitt isn't the most moral man. He has been intangled into allegations, too. He worked on mirmax pictures and I don't think he was oblivious to what was going on. And even if Gweneth's story is true, that doesn't make Brad a good man.

From the prioritizing of young attractive, upper class white women over others, to the weaponizing of MeToo allegations for political and/or personal reasons, to the delegitimatizing of due process, etc. I think it's safe to say that the MeToo wave doesn't have the same hold on our culture as it did back in 2017 and I think a lot of people don't want to go back to 2017. And yes, sexual harassment and abuse is still a problem but how we see and talk about these problems are less black and white then it was just a few years ago. 

This film may be a box office hit and it may be really good film, but I just don't believe it would be as culturally significant as it would have been if it was realized a couple years earlier. I honestly think people are ready to evolve beyond the MeToo phenomenon into a nuanced and sophisticated cultural landscape.",Thread,2022-08-02T23:01:31Z,,,2,en,0.1455246913580247,0.116,0.063,0.821,0.9198,,,,

All you women who were furious that Hillary lost but delighted to see Harvey finally exposed realize this is the ironic truth.

If you had gotten Queen Hillary as Madam President you never would have seen Harvey be exposed the way he was. You would have gotten your First Woman President but Harvey would have been More Powerful than ever he would have been Supremely Powerful as a major money raiser for Hillary, he would have been untouchable. 

I challenge any woman to reply to this let's see how honest you are about what I wrote above there is no way you can debunk this the two things were mutually exclusive - Hillary would have been Harvey's most powerful protector she would have him to the White House every month for a visit because she relied on him to raise money for her re-election campaign with all his powerful showbiz friends.

The irony is so amazing even you being a feminist must see it or do you lack that self-awareness? Do you really believe if Hillary had won you could have seen Harvey get taken down and destroyed the way he was? That never would have happened he would have continued to do what he did his entire life and he'd have been at Hillary's White House every month being photographed in his tuxedo.",Thread,2022-07-14T19:01:39Z,,,0,en,0.2328472222222222,0.183,0.067,0.75,0.9919,,,,

Brad did stand up for Gwyneth against Harvey when he found out but like what the hell were her parents doing to protect their only daughter in that industry. I mean her mom was an actress herself so surely she would have known about all the wolves and predators in the industry. Your comment implies that she did have a sexual relationship with Harvey which she was pressurized or forced into. I mean if that's true then what the F were her parents doing at that time? Write they just stoned out of their minds or they intentionally chose to look the other way? Like she comes from a rich influential family. So hearing that some of Harvey's victims were star kids and even actors from rich influential actors is obviously very shocking because one would assume at least they would have a Teflon coating or barbed wire of protection around them in that sense. I remember reading some interview which quoted Nicole Kidman saying that her relationship and marriage to Tom who she started dating when  she she was 22  kept her protected and free from any inappropriate and unsolicited advances from anyone or any casting coach scenarios because Tom was one of the top superstars in the industry even during the early 90s. If Gwyneth despite being a star kid and very privileged chose to work  with Harvey and tolerate his abuse when she had the privilege of nepotism and connections to work with many other producers who weren't assholes and perverts...then sorry but I have zero respect for her. And she worked with him on multiple projects even the Talented Mr Ripley.  Matt Damon said in an interview he had heard about the issues between Gwyneth and Harvey through his close friend Ben who was dating her after Brad, but didn't say anything because he thought they had worked out their differences privately between themselves.

You‚Äôve got to remember that Weinstein controlled Hollywood. He was higher on the totem pole than even the likes of Tom Cruise. That‚Äôs really disrespectful to say you don‚Äôt have respect for Gwyneth when she must have felt so trapped knowing that even her established affluent parents couldn‚Äôt do anything. It‚Äôs not as though she was in a position to speak out; imagine being a collage-aged woman with your first Oscar and knowing that it would all be ripped away from you if you spoke out against the culture you were conditioned into accepting of dismissing an abuser, who she may have known had abused other women. If she was aware of that then she likely felt as though rebelling against him was fruitless. Look what happened with Mira Sorvino and Ashley Judd when they did just that. They were blackballed just as their careers were progressing. It‚Äôs so easy to stand on the sidelines and claim Gwyneth should have done the same as those women, but perhaps she also knew about them as well. The knowledge that nothing happened to Weinstein as a result would have just further solidified her views that she was powerless. View the industry which allowed abuse of women to occur silently and which coerced them into accepting abuse and casting couches with contempt, not Gwyneth Paltrow.",Reply,2022-08-22T03:32:33Z,UgyahiTuZWqKw24u0Dt4AaABAg,@nikitamohanan2124,0,en,0.1472222222222222,0.085,0.173,0.742,-0.9848,,,,

But like most women who supposedly had something done to them by Harvey Weinstein Angelina stay quiet and complicit about what it had allegedly happened to her while her career benefited from it. Brad Pitt at least stood up to Harvey Weinstein and risked his career. What's that also forget about the fact that Angelina Jolie grew up in Hollywood because of her dad Jon Voight and so she would have been well aware of what Harvey Wednesday was like before she even worked with him as well and she still chose to. Just like she chose to stay quiet and complicit until her career wouldn't have been on the line for coming forward.  And those two movies that Brad happened to be in that were only distributed by the Weinstein company. Brad had already been cast in both those movies and had nothing to do with the Harvey Weinstein being hired to help distribute the movies but it's already been confirmed that those two movies that Brad was in that Harvey Weinstein help to distribute those movies.

Either way, shaming and blaming isn't the same as accountability. I'm not going to shame another woman for her choices, nor am I going to impose my morality upon her because that doesn't encourage positive change in someone's life. It contributes to insecurities. Accountability comes from within. It's looking at situations/experiences we've had and identifying what if any part of those experiences we might have unintentionally contributed to because of the insecurities, then work through the trauma to change our thoughts, beliefs, and actions that don't serve us. With regard to men harassing women because of the way we dress, how many men experience the same treatment when they're shirtless? Very, very few. Men are not held to the same expectations as women in our society. This is a cultural failure that has been perpetuated by men and some women. The women who support those ideas, who believe women deserve to be harassed in any way based on their attire ought to take a deeper dive into their own bias and ask themselves why they feel that way? So much of what we believe is rooted in the negative beliefs that we have about ourselves and others and those beliefs are the foundation that shapes our cultural norms. We can't change other people.

They both hit and berated each other in a toxic relationship. They should have settled it privately. They both wanted fame back from this and it was sorely selfish. Sorely selfish because she tried to claim she was a survivor while also being the perpetrator. Sorely selfish because JD claimed she was straight up lying about it all, and he needs his career back.

Weinstein is a sex offender who deserves a lifetime sentence; there's not a single denial of that coming from me. What I am denying is the notion that now because Weinstein abused women, that means now we're forced to automatically believe any random woman who claims some male associate of hers harassed her. This film, ""She Said"", seems to be a bit too one-sided for me. It's showing that women are the victims of big macho male producers in Hollywood without even bothering to expose the shocking growth of male victims of sexual abuse such as those who were victims of Kevin Spacey. ""She Said"" isn't impartial or bipartisan or centrist or really any adjective that can describe an objective film that simply retells a recent sex scandal. Instead, ""She Said"" will probably have some woke radical-feminist message that glorifies misandry and eep like that. Just look at the film's title: ""She Said"". Not ""We Said"", there's no sense of gender equality to permeate onto us, the audience, here. Feminism is an engine that must be shut down before it shuttles every member of womankind to the island of Lesbos where they'll probably meet their deaths at the hands of each other. Why don't we ever get a film about male victims of sexual abuse, especially if the abuser is a woman? Why is there always a film that always shows women as pitiful victims who have to uproot the ""patriarchy"" (horse-poop, btw) in order to feel empowered? If I made a film where lonely, lost, wonderful men had to uproot the matriarchy in order to feel wonderfully empowered, feminazis would screech. & yes, even though I'm a frum religious Jew, I am comfortable with deeming radical-feminists feminazis.

Ever seen a DV victim repeatedly go back to their abuser, still say they love them, even having children with them? That happens most of the time. Guess what? The abuse was still real and non-consensual. What kind of relationship you maintain with someone after they‚Äôve abused/violated you does not retroactively make it consensual. This kind of argument is victim-blaming by the way. And women falsely accusing men in order to get ‚Äúbig payouts‚Äù? Yeah that‚Äôs super sexist.
